# --- Day 19: An Elephant Named Joseph ---
#
# The Elves contact you over a highly secure emergency channel. Back at the North Pole, the Elves
# are busy misunderstanding White Elephant parties.
#
# Each Elf brings a present. They all sit in a circle, numbered starting with position 1. Then,
# starting with the first Elf, they take turns stealing all the presents from the Elf to their
# left.  An Elf with no presents is removed from the circle and does not take turns.
#
# For example, with five Elves (numbered 1 to 5):
#
#   1
# 5   2
#  4 3
#
#
# Elf 1 takes Elf 2's present.
# Elf 2 has no presents and is skipped.
# Elf 3 takes Elf 4's present.
# Elf 4 has no presents and is also skipped.
# Elf 5 takes Elf 1's two presents.
# Neither Elf 1 nor Elf 2 have any presents, so both are skipped.
# Elf 3 takes Elf 5's three presents.
#
# So, with five Elves, the Elf that sits starting in position 3 gets all the presents.
#
# With the number of Elves given in your puzzle input, which Elf gets all the presents?
#
