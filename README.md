# Advent of Code 2015 #

Solutions for the 2016 edition of the Advent of Code - http://adventofcode.com/2016

Back again for another year, the little [Advent of Code] site that has a new pair of problems to solve each new day (i.e., midnight Eastern time) and this repository holds my solutions using [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)

My solutions for the original 2015 installment of the Advent of Code is in the repo: [rab/adventofcode2015](https://github.com/rab/adventofcode2015)
